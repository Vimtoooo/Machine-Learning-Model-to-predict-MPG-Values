For this task, we will utilize the `scikit-learn` library and the coding environment will be within VS Code!

## Libraries:

- `scikit-learn`: For data separation (training and test), training, building these models and predicting their values;
- `pandas`: For data visualization and analysis;
- `ipynbkernel`: Utilization of the `ipynb` files.
